# SLIDER.JS

## Usage

`new Slider (id, imgs, interval, autostart)`, with `id` as the
container's `id` (the one which the background image will be changed),
`imgs` as the images urls (array of strings), `interval` the time
between two pictures change, and `autostart` as a boolean indicating
whether the slider should be started automatically or not.
